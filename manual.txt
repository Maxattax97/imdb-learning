How to Run Our Code:
You must be using Python 3.x in order to use our project. See the External Libraries section to get your environment set up.
    $ ./run.py
This will ultimately generate plots in the ./visuals/ folder.

The provided run.py will also automate downloading the IMDB dataset and associated pre-processing to produce the needed files.
If you delete the provided ./dataset/dataset.csv and ./dataset/dataset.json files, it will trigger download of the full dataset and cleaning.
Note that this is a lengthy process and requires a somewhat significant amount of memory.

Speeding Up:
Visualizations generate an interactive window with all plots as well as static PNG images.
To speed up the process, you can disable viewing all plots and instead view the static images at your leisure.
To do so, find:
    MEGA_FIGURE = True
near the top of ./sources/visualize.py and set it to False.
This is not a very slow process with it included by default, however.

External Libraries:
We use a few Python libraries. To fetch them, set up a Python 3.x virtual environment:
    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source ./env/bin/activate # You must run this in every fresh session.
    $ pip3 install -r ./libraries/requirements.txt
