How to run our code:
You must be using Python 3.x in order to use our project. See the External Libraries section to get your environment set up.
    $ ./main.py
This will generate plots in the ./visuals/ folder.

External Libraries:
We use a few Python libraries. To fetch them, set up a Python 3.x virtual environment:
    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source ./env/bin/activate # You must run this in every fresh session.
    $ pip3 install -r ./libraries/requirements.txt
